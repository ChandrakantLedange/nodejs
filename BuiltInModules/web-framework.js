//What is web framework
// -A framework simply abstracts the lower level code allowing you to focus the requirement than th code itself.

//For Ex - Angular, React ,Vue are all framework/library that help you build user interface without having to rely on the lower level DOM API in javascript.

//There are frameworks to build web or mobile applications without havig to rely on the HTTP module in nodejs

//For Ex - Express js ,nest, hapi, koa and sails.

//They build on top of the HTTP module making it easier for you to implememntall the feature.
